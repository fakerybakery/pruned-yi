# Pruned Yi

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Models-blue)](https://huggingface.co/pruned-yi)

Creating <6B SLM models based on 01.AI's amazing Yi models!

Models are pruned using the awesome [ShortGPT](https://github.com/sramshetty/ShortGPT) codebase.

**Not affiliated with 01.AI in any way.**

## Steps

1. The models are pruned from Yi 1.5 6B using [ShortGPT](https://github.com/sramshetty/ShortGPT).
2. The models are healed (further pretrained) on data. See the Data section below for more details.

## Data

Once the models are pruned they must be "healed" on data to generate coherent text. Since Yi is a bilingual (English + Chinese) model, the data should be bilingual to maintain the model's capabilities. Pruned Yi primarily focuses on English, so the ratio of English to Chinese text is about 2:1. The following datasets may be used:

**Base models:**

* [Cosmopedia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/cosmopedia)
* Select, cleaned articles from Chinese Wikipedia converted to Simplified Chinese

**Conversational models:**

For conversational models, a two-stage training method should be employed. First, the conversational models should be trained on the same data as the base models. Then, the models can be trained on the following datasets:

* [SlimOrca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/SlimOrca)

## Models

Models are still a work-in-progress. Models are listed in this section.
